# battlescript
A simple Hack'n'slash style game idea where users provide scripts that define how their heros fight.

There are weapons.
There are no magic powers.
There are no powerups.

There are no clans.  Every player for themselves.

Each players fighting rules is their secret, not shown to other players.

Using a very simple attribute system
### Health
A hero's level governs their maximum HEALTH points.
If health reaches 0, the hero is removed from the battle.

### Stamina
STAMINA is slowly increased during a battle (to it's maximum).  Almost all actions use stamina, faster than it has been generated.  To increase stamina don't do anything that uses it.  Stamina gives you an extra 'oomph' when attacking or receiving a blow.

### Attack
Combined with STRENGTH and STAMINA and offset against the enemy's DEFENCE to reduce enemy HEALTH.  You can increase your ATTACK with CREDITS but there is a negative effect to your speed

### Defence
Combined with STRENGTH and STAMINNA and offset against the enemy's ATTACK to reduce the effect the attack has on your HEALTH.  You can increase your DEFENCE with CREDITS but there is a negative effect to your dodge (speed)

### Speed
when MOVING, SPEED is rounded up to the nearest whole number.  In other calculations, SPEED is used rounded to 3 decimal places.
, but is affected negatively by weight
  Improves chances of dodging an ATTACK.
  Improves chances of landing an ATTACK.
  In instances where both parties ATTACK simultaneously, a faster ATTACK will reduce the effect of the opponent's ATTACK
  Using speed affects stamina
  SPEED can be improved by credits.

### Strength
How hard you can hit.  STAMINA affects STRENGTH.  Using STRENGTH spends STAMINA

### Carry Weight
your base ATTACK + base DEFENCE + STRENGTH
If you have used credits to improve your attack or defence, your speed, ability to dodge and block will be affected.

### Credits
You spend credits to improve your Attack, Defence, Health.  
Because effectively you are turning credits into health (through first aid)
When you reduce another player's health, that gets converted into credits that you have earned in your attack.  Even if you ultimately lose a match, you get something for what you did achieve while still functional.

Note:  when MOVING, SPEED is rounded up to the nearest whole number.  In other calculations, SPEED is used rounded to 3 decimal places.

# Regeneration during battle
HEALTH can be regenerated by using first aid kits which must be purchased prior to battle.



# Battle Scripts

You can fight with up to 5 battlescripts.  Each script respresenting a Hero.

You can choose to:
Attack, and what strength you will attack with
Defend, and what strength you will defend with
Dodge, based on speed, doesn't affect strength, affects stamina.
Move toward or away from enemies

Chance plays a role in the outcome.

We use a basic random function between 0 and 1.  

## Battle Arena
The battle happens on a 7x11 2D grid.
...........
.X.......X.
...X...X...
.X.......X.
...X...X...
.X.......X.
...........

Players can move up, down, left, right.  not diagonally.  only one player can be in any grid position.  This design is to force players into combat.
In order to fight they need to be immediately beside each other.
Adjacent players on opposing teams can fight (not diagonaly).  There are currently no ranged attacks.

Turn based in following steps
* MOVE.  
** Heros can see all stats and player's current position, so can make choices
** run away from stronger characters
** move toward weaker characters
** assist team members
** apply first aid to yourself (no move)
** stand still

* PLAN
** If Hero is not beside an enemy, they can make a move decision again.
** If Hero is beside a team member, then can choose to apply first aid (which they give up themselves)
** Attack Plan - player choses who (if beside more than one enemy), and how they will attack 
** Defend Plan - based on players attack (result unknown), will you defend/dodge or continue attack?

* ACTION
** Attack Plan / Defend Plan is executed
*** If both players attack, both do damage
*** If both players defend, no damage is dealt
*** Apply first aid if applying it to another team member


# League
All players automatically take part in a league against other players with the same experience points.

Starts with 16 teams.  Each 24 hours a league battle occurs.

Players are put into their current experience level group at the beginning league.
There is a random draw.  
Up to the start of a league match, players continue battling normally in the arena.  If their stats have improved - so be it
Health and Stamina are recharged only for the league match (does not affect regular stats)
Heros earn their usual credits and experience from participating in a league match.

# Betting
No real money.  Just fun and bragging rights.
League games allow players to bet on the outcome.
Players can bet credits on the outcome of each battle.  They can also bet on the league winner.




# Leaderboards
A whole bunch of player stats where players can choose to try to improve their ranking.
